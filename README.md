# Test Automation Examples

This repository demonstrates practical test automation approaches commonly used in production systems. It is intended as a portfolio example for automation, CI/CD, and test strategy.

---

## Overview

The repository contains three layers of testing:

1. **UI Automation**  
   - Implemented using **Selenium** and **Pytest**.  
   - Demonstrates Page Object Model (POM), headless execution, and explicit waits.  
   - Example test: login flow or search functionality.

2. **API Testing**  
   - Implemented using **ROBOT Framework** and **Requests**.  
   - Demonstrates authentication, status and schema validation, and parameterized tests.

3. **Database Validation**  
   - Implemented using Python and NoSQL database calls.  
   - Demonstrates data seeding, query validation, and test cleanup.

Each layer is executed independently in **CI/CD pipelines** to mirror real-world test strategies.
